## 2- Features 
### Action Recognition 
- the model can detect actions such as foul, goal, corners as if it was the referee of the match. The model achieves acceptable accuracy of 72% based on our quick tests.
- **input** is a clip of the match or the whole match.
- **output** is the same clip with the action predictions as subtitles.
